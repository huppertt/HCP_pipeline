Files in this distribution:

Binary folders for MacosX, Ubuntu, Centos. Within each folder: 

msm - the msmbinary msmapplywarp - binary for projecting deformation to new surfaces msmresample - binary for resampling featuremaps though the warp estimate_metric_distortion - estimates areal distortion configMSMsulc - a registration config file optimised by the HCP for pre-alignment of the HCP parcellation

Licenses - including copy of the ELC and FastPD licence info.

allparameterssulcDRconfStage1to4 - config file for run MSM cortical folding alignment (HCP multimodal parcellation compatible)
config_strain_STRAIN_SPHERE_shear20_within -config file to run MSM cortical folding alignment for optimised alignment of folds (optimised on neonatal data)
config_MSMsulc_pairwise - this is a config file compatible with the original (pairwise) MSM framework. It will run much faster than the new forms, but the methos is less robust to noise and topological variations in the data

Description:

The MSM software series are cortical surface registration tools designed for flexible alignment of multiple different types of data on the cortical surface. MSM_HOCR represents an adaption to the 2014 Neuroimage version of the MSM software that allows improved regularisation through use of the Higher Order Clique Reduction libraries (HOCR and ELC) written by Hiroshi Ishikawa. These improvements have proved essential to achieve the alignments of areal features as described in the HCP's "A Multimodal parcellation of the Human Cerebral Cortex" Glasser, et al. Nature 2016. 

Its important to note this version MSM performs discrete optimisation implemented using fastPD not QPBO (as quoted in the upcoming MSM paper, and in the ELC READMetxt). The licence for QPBO is not compatible with FSL or this licence.

FastPD and ELC are restricted licence libraries which we have gained permission to use as part of the MSM software (see below). For this reason, we are releasing only binaries at this time (for Ubuntu and Centos Linux, and MacOs). Source code will be released as part of the next FSL software library release. We supply an example config file for MSMsulc (MSMall parameters are on the way). Please contact if you have any problems


Usage:

See http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/msm

Additional config parameters for MSM_HOCR

--regoption can take vales from 1 (original pairwise MSM) to 3. Options reflect different regulariser choices. 2-5 are higher order methods: 2) Angular Deviation Penalty (ADP); used by the HCP parcellation paper; 3) Strain penalty 
--triclique estimate a triclique data likelihood 
--shearmod shear modulus parameter for strain likelihood 
--bulkmod bulk modulus parameter for strain likelihood

A new paper on the methods used in MSM_HOCR is under review. In the meantime please refer to Glocker et al ECCV 2010 (below) for more details on the Higher Order Clique Reduction and the motivations for the ADP and triclique data terms
